            <p>Famous for Culture and unique landscapes, SINTRA is a MUST, too EPIC to be missed! From a Freemason Palace to a stunning WEST COAST, ending up in beautiful WOODS that will remind you of "LORD OF THE RINGS", Sintra is more than what everyone thinks<span id="dots">... </span><span id="more">That's why we started a small Company - "Keep it Local Tours"!</p>
            <p>So our DAY TOGETHER:</p>
