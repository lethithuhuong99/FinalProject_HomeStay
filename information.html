            <h3>About your host</h3>
            <p>Olá from Duarte & Friends: </p>
            <p>We don't like to brag about our experience because this all started with a 1st daytrip w/ foreign buddies - 6 years ago - to a place I called home for as long as I remember – Sintra! (my family has farms in the forest for 100 years) </p>
            <p>After that day, I realized that more than a tour I could provide an unforgettable day between friends with simply wonderful moments together... feeling just like LOCALS! This is how I started my small company - Keep it Local Tours</p>
            <p>As you can read, my Friends know what they are doing too, so a Dream Team is set and ready for You!</p>
          </div>

              We loved this tour and our group so much! Our guide Ricardo was so fun and knowledgeable, he made us all comfortable right from the start. The tour itself takes you to amazing and beautiful places that it would be so hard to see on your own. I highly recommend this tour. Thank you for a wonderful day!

              This experience is an absolute must if you visit Lisbon. Duarte’s friend Ricardo was my host. He is knowledgeable, created a good vibe, and did an absolute exceptional job in guiding us around, and at many times letting us explore Sintra by ourselves to take in the breath taking views. The meal (which doesn’t come included in the price as clearly stated) was absolutely delicious! One of the best I have ever had - I’m not kidding. Book this trip if you want a special memory that you’ll never forget :).

              Such a unique experience! I was hoping to spend a day in Sintra, and since I was traveling alone, this day trip was perfect! Duarte was extremely friendly and knowledgeable, and he kept us laughing throughout the tour. This was the most excellent way to find the best views and foods in Sintra!
