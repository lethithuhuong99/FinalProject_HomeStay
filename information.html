          <h3>About your host</h3>
          <p>Olá from Duarte & Friends: </p>
          <p>We don't like to brag about our experience because this all started with a 1st daytrip w/ foreign buddies - 6 years ago - to a place I called home for as long as I remember – Sintra! (my family has farms in the forest for 100 years) </p>
          <p>After that day, I realized that more than a tour I could provide an unforgettable day between friends with simply wonderful moments together... feeling just like LOCALS! This is how I started my small company - Keep it Local Tours</p>
          <p>As you can read, my Friends know what they are doing too, so a Dream Team is set and ready for You!</p>
